Dear [name],

Thank you for submitting your proposal to the FOSDEM [year] Open Source
Design Devroom.

Unfortunately based on the voting scores your session [session name] wasn’t included in the final program.

I hope you're still able to attend FOSDEM. If so please do come along to the
devroom - we will be located in [room number].

Best wishes to you,

[name]
- on behalf of the devroom co-ordinators and the Open Source Design Collective
